Commands should be pretty straight forward. This was an interview and my first foray into programming in ruby. I focused on doing my best to program in a ruby fashion rather than just program in python with ruby syntax. Every language seems to lend itself to different approaches to problems and I felt if I approached this as if I were programming in python, I wouldn't learn much.

As a whole, I'm happy with how this turned out. Everything feels quite well-modularized and self-contained. This made testing and the final game playing method very straight forward.
